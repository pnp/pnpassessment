# SharePoint Alerts Assessment

The Microsoft 365 Assessment Tool helps you identify and evaluate the SharePoint Alerts usage on your tenant by providing you the [usage data of SharePoint Alerts](assess.md), and generating a [Power BI report](report-intro.md) to help plan migrating SharePoint Alerts usage to Power Automate or SharePoint Rules.
