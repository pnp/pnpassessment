# Run an SharePoint Alerts assessment

Running the SharePoint Alerts assessment is just like running any other adoption or deprecation module of the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool: you use the CLI with the `Start` action to launch an assessment. By specifying the `--mode` to be `Alerts` the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool will run the SharePoint Alerts assessment for you. This page provides you with a quick start and links to the relevant Microsoft 365 Assessment tool documentation for more details.

## Quick start

### Download the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool

The Microsoft 365 Assessment tool must first be downloaded from https://github.com/pnp/pnpassessment/releases. More details can be found in the [download](../using-the-assessment-tool/download.md) documentation.

### Ensure you've an Entra application setup

The Microsoft 365 Assessment tool requires an Entra application for authenticating to SharePoint. More details in the [authentication](../using-the-assessment-tool/setupauth.md) documentation.

> [!Important]
> It's essential you grant the needed permission as listed in [permissions](requirements.md), without these correct permission scopes the Alerts module will not work.

### Start assessment

Below are some quick start samples that show how to run a SharePoint Alerts assessment. More details on the `Start` action can be found in the [Microsoft 365 Assessment tool Start documentation](../using-the-assessment-tool/assess-start.md).

Task | CLI
-----|------
Start a new SharePoint Alerts assessment (application permissions) for a complete tenant | microsoft365-assessment.exe start --mode Alerts --authmode application <br> --tenant bertonline.sharepoint.com --applicationid c545f9ce-1c11-440b-812b-0b35217d9e83 <br> --certpath "My&#124;CurrentUser&#124;b133d1cb4d19ce539986c7ac67de005481084c84" <br>

### Live status updates

Once an assessment is launched you'd typically followup on it's status via the `Status` action. Below is a quick start, more details can be found in the [Microsoft 365 Assessment tool operations documentation](../using-the-assessment-tool/assess-operations.md#getting-a-live-status-overview-of-a-running-assessment).

Task | CLI
-----|------
