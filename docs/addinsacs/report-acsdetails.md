## ACS Principal details

Provider Hosted SharePoint Add-Ins use an Azure ACS principal (a.k.a application) to enable the Add-In provider code to call back into the needed SharePoint APIs (e.g. the Add-In will add a list item). The details of the used Azure ACS principal are shown in this section, key fields are:

- **Expiration date**: By default the Azure ACS principals are generated with a two year valid secret, this field shows the expiration date of the most recent secret. If the secret has expired it means the SharePoint Add-In is not able to read/update data in SharePoint Online and is in a broken state
- **Use App-Only**: Can this ACS principal be used in scenarios that require application permissions?

When a principal was granted access to specific sites you can see the sites in the shown table, if the table lists `<tenant>` then the Azure ACS principal was also granted a tenant scoped permission.

More details about the returned field and their possible values can be found in the documentation of the generated [Azure ACS principals csv file](csv-classicacsprincipals.md).
