General
-------
To setup "initial" status delete current cs files in the DatabaseMigration folder and call from the package manager console:

Add-Migration -Name v0.2.0 -Project PnP.Scanning.Core -OutputDir Storage\DatabaseMigration -StartupProject PnP.Scanning.Process

After making a model change call call below to add a new migration step.
Add-Migration -Name <model change name> -Project PnP.Scanning.Core -OutputDir Storage\DatabaseMigration -StartupProject PnP.Scanning.Process

Alternative way to remove migration classes:
Remove-Migration -Project PnP.Scanning.Core -StartupProject PnP.Scanning.Process

When developing
---------------
After adding a table you've called

Add-Migration -Name v1.6.1 -Project PnP.Scanning.Core -OutputDir Storage\DatabaseMigration -StartupProject PnP.Scanning.Process

Before releasing you're making additional database changes. To get them included do:
- Delete generated migration step (e.g. 20221222133309_v1.6.1.cs)
- Clean new tables/changes from ScanContextModelSnapshot.cs
- Run again: Add-Migration -Name v1.6.1 -Project PnP.Scanning.Core -OutputDir Storage\DatabaseMigration -StartupProject PnP.Scanning.Process

Given you're previously created databases might already have been updated it can be needed to drop these


IMPORTANT!!
Always check for drops or renames in the generated migration code!
