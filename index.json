It does so in three areas: Content understanding : Create AI models that capture expertise to classify and extract information and automatically apply metadata. Content processing : Automate the capture, ingestion, and categorization of content and streamline content-centric processes. Content compliance : Connect and manage content to improve security and compliance. If you are considering a trial of Microsoft Syntex, or have purchased and have just started on your journey, you might be wondering where to begin. Many customers start their Microsoft Syntex journey with a specific scenario in mind but want to know where else Microsoft Syntex might be able to help. Others see value in the technology, but can’t identify that first use case to make it real. Using the Microsoft Syntex Assessment, the first module of the new Microsoft 365 Assessment Tool, enables you to gather data about your SharePoint libraries , and generate a Power BI report with recommendations of where Syntex might fit and bring added value for your organization. These recommendations are based on factors such as the size and structure of libraries, the existing use of metadata or content types, and the use of retention labels."

    "keywords": "Assessment operational tasks So you've kicked off an assessment and want to followup on the assessment progress or you want to pause a running assessment because you need to shut down the computer running the assessment. All of these tasks, and more, are possible using the operational actions supported by the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool. Listing the available assessments Assessment data is gathered inside folders underneath the folder hosting the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool and you can enumerate the done, running, paused and terminated assessments via the list action. Sample list commands Before diving into all the possible command line arguments let's first show some typical use cases: Task CLI List all the assessments microsoft365-assessment.exe list List the paused assessments microsoft365-assessment.exe list --paused Command line arguments The easiest way to see all possible command line arguments for a command (e.g. for list ) is using the --help parameter. Listing specific assessments By default all assessments will be returned ordered by assessment status, followed by a order on assessment age. This means that most recent assessments will be at the bottom of the list. You can however only list assessments in a given status by using either the --running , --paused , --finished or --terminated arguments. These argument can be combined to for example list all paused and terminated assessments. List output When using the list action a table is generated listing all the assessment that match the criteria. Following columns are listed in the table: Column Description Id The assessment id Mode The assessment mode (e.g. Syntex) defines the adoption or deprecation scenario the assessment is targeting Status The assessment status: finished is a successfully ended assessment, paused is a paused assessment, running is an assessment that still is in progress and terminated means that the assessment was interrupted (e.g. when the computer running the assessment was shut down) Progress Shows how many site collections of the total in scope site collections are assessed Started at When was this assessment for the first time started Ended at When was this assessment finished Getting a live status overview of a running assessment Once an assessment is started you often want to see it's progress. For that you can use the above described list action, but more convenient for this purpose is the status action as it does a continuos refresh, hence providing a live status overview. Sample status command Task CLI Realtime status update of the running assessments microsoft365-assessment.exe status Status output When using the status action a table is generated listing all the running assessments. Following columns are listed in the table: Column Description Id The assessment id Mode The assessment mode (e.g. Syntex) defines the adoption or deprecation scenario the assessment is targeting Status The assessment status: finished is a successfully ended assessment, paused is a paused assessment, running is an assessment that still is in progress and terminated means that the assessment was interrupted (e.g. when the computer running the assessment was shut down) Progress Shows how many site collections of the total in scope site collections are assessed Retries Whenever a request is queued for retry a counter will increased. Throttled requests are counted in the first section (1 in the screenshot), requests failed due to network issues are listed in the second section (0 in the screenshot) Session start When was this assessment run started. If you've restarted an assessment the restart time is shown here Session duration How long has the current assessment session been running I'm scanning a huge number of site collections and the assessment seems to be stuck, what should I do? When the assessment runs it will use 2 parallel operations per site collection for processing the sites and sub sites combined with multiple parallel operations processing site collections. This means that when the assessment is processing site collections with a large amount of sub sites this can take a while. The easiest approach to understand if an assessment is still progressing in checking the status output (Progress column), but if that's not changing anymore taking a peek at the last log entries will provide clarity: Go the folder hosting the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool Open the sub folder for your assessment (assessment id = sub folder name) On Windows use Get-Content .\\log_a9dc3fda-e14b-421e-8a85-cbb9b1c4ebfa.txt -Tail 20 -Wait to keep showing the last 20 lines of your log file, on macOS and Linux use tail log_e1396c6c-5ff0-4b4f-af00-a7c596ea82f0.txt -n 20 -f If the log file is not showing any meaningful updates for a long time then the assessment might be stuck. If that's the case then: Continue with pausing the assessment via microsoft365-assessment.exe pause --id <assessment id> . See next chapters for details Stop all assessment processes microsoft365-assessment.exe stop . See here for details Restart the assessment via microsoft365-assessment.exe restart --id <assessment id> . See next chapters for details Pausing a running assessment Sometimes you need to pause a running assessment because you need to shutdown the computer running the assessment or the assessment is very heavily throttled. This is possible using the pause action. Sample pause command Task CLI Pause a running assessment microsoft365-assessment.exe pause --id 22989c75-f08f-4af9-8857-6f19e333d6d3 Command line arguments The easiest way to see all possible command line arguments for a command (e.g. for pause ) is using the --help parameter. By default you pause one assessment by specifying the assessment to pause using the --id argument, but you can also opt to pause all running assessments using the -all:$true argument. Restarting a paused or terminated assessment Sample restart command Task CLI Restart a paused or terminated assessment microsoft365-assessment.exe restart --id 22989c75-f08f-4af9-8857-6f19e333d6d3 Command line arguments The easiest way to see all possible command line arguments for a command (e.g. for restart ) is using the --help parameter. Restarting happens per assessment and you specify the assessment to restart via the --id argument. When restarting an assessment you do have the option to change the number of parallel operations via the --threads argument. If you omit this argument the assessment will restart using the number of parallel operations set at assessment start. Clearing authentication caches When using delegated permissions in combination with either --authmode equal to Interactive or Device then you're seeing a one time prompt for credentials when you use this option for the first time. As part of this operation the authentication library (MSAL) state is cached on disk using machine/user specific encryption. With this cache the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool can automatically request new access tokens whenever that's needed. If you're however switching between tenants or you want to remove this stored cache you can do so via the cache action. Sample clearing authentication caches command Task CLI Clear authentication cache microsoft365-assessment.exe cache --clearauthentication Note An alternative way of clearing this cache is by deleting the msalcache.bin file inside the folder hosting microsoft365-assessment.exe ."

    "title": "Create assessment report | Microsoft 365 Assessment Tool",
    "keywords": "Create assessment report When an assessment run completes the typical next step is to produce a report or use the gathered data in some other form. These actions can be realized using the report option of the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool. For all adoption or deprecation scenarios implemented in the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool you can request a Power BI report that visualizes and summarizes the gathered data, enabling you to interpret the results and take the necessary actions. The generated Power BI report uses CSV files as data source and these files are created together with the report. Sample report commands Before diving into all the possible command line arguments let's first show some typical use cases: Task CLI Generate Power BI report (includes CSV export) in the default location microsoft365-assessment.exe report --id 22989c75-f08f-4af9-8857-6f19e333d6d3 Export the gathered data as CSV files in a custom location microsoft365-assessment.exe report --id 22989c75-f08f-4af9-8857-6f19e333d6d3 --mode CsvOnly --path \"c:\\reports\" Power BI The report format used by the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool is Power BI and we've chosen this option for a number of reasons: after running an assessment and generating a report you often want to share it with other teams inside your organization. A Power BI report can be published to the Power BI service and then easily shared with and consumed by your other stakeholders. Also, sometimes the default generated reports might not fully satisfy your needs, using Power BI Desktop it is easy to update the generated report to fit your needs. Dependency on Power BI Desktop (Windows version) After generating the Power BI report the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool will automatically open the report in Power BI Desktop. If you've not installed Power BI Desktop the report will still be generated, but opening it will fail. You can install Power BI Desktop from https://aka.ms/pbidesktopstore . After the report has opened in the Power BI Desktop the data will refresh, depending on the data size this can take a while to complete, so please allow Power BI Desktop enough time to complete the data refresh. When the data refresh is done you can start using the report, given the generated report is based upon a Power BI pbit file it means that you can save the report using the pbix format. Doing so will combine the data and the report into a single Power BI pbix file, which can then be easily copied and shared. Note When you're using the macOS or Linux version there never will a Power BI report generated as there's no Power BI Desktop product for macOS and Linux. If you later on want to generate the Power BI report for an assessment ran on Linux of macOS, you then can copy the assessment output folder (guid = assessment id, located in the folder containing the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool) to the folder on a Windows machine where you've put the Windows version of the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool. When you then use microsoft365-assessment.exe report --id <assessment id> the report will be generated and opened in Power BI Desktop. Command line arguments The easiest way to see all possible command line arguments for a command (e.g. for report ) is using the --help parameter. Mandatory arguments The key argument to specify is the --id argument as that will allow you to select the assessment for which a report must be generated. It's the easiest to copy the needed assessment id by using the list option as described in the assessment operations documentation. The report mode argument ( --mode ) is also required but since it defaults to PowerBI you don't need to specify it to create a Power BI report. If you however only want to generate CSV files then you need to set --mode to CsvOnly . Report location via --path By default the assessment Power BI report and CSV files are generated inside a subfolder named Report underneath the report containing your assessment data. So assuming the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool was added in folder c:\\Microsoft365AssessmentTool and the assessment id is 22989c75-f08f-4af9-8857-6f19e333d6d3 , then the report will live in c:\\Microsoft365AssessmentTool\\22989c75-f08f-4af9-8857-6f19e333d6d3\\report . If you prefer to put the created Power BI report and CSV files in another location then you can specify the custom location via the --path argument. A sample: --path \"c:\\reports\" . Report delimiter setting via --delimiter When exporting the CSV files, which are used as data source for the Power BI report, by default the comma ( , ) is used as delimiter. If you're planning to also consume the CSV files directly and you're living in a country that uses semicolon ( ; ) as delimiter then you can override the default delimiter via the --delimiter argument. A sample: --delimiter Semicolon . Controlling the Power BI report opening via --open By default the generated Power BI report will open in Power BI Desktop. If you prefer to not open the report you can specify that via the --open argument. A sample: --open:$false ."

Available as of version 1.6.0 Assessment scope When running an assessment you do have the option to scope the assessment to either the complete tenant or a set of site collections. When running an assessment for all site collections in your tenant then you have to specify the required --tenant argument. Some samples are: --tenant bertonline.sharepoint.com or --tenant sites.contoso.com in case you're using vanity URLs. If you want to limit the assessment to one or more site collections then you additionally can add either the --siteslist argument or the --sitesfile argument. Important When you're using a vanity URL tenant you also need to either use the --sitesfile or --siteslist arguments when starting a new assessment . Enumerating all site collections in a vanity URL tenant will be added in a future release. Scoping via --siteslist When using the --siteslist argument you can on the command line provided a comma delimited list of site collections that will have to be assessed. A sample: --siteslist \"https://bertonline.sharepoint.com/sites/ussales,https://bertonline.sharepoint.com/sites/europesales,https://bertonline.sharepoint.com/sites/apacsales\" . Note You cannot combine both --siteslist and --sitesfile . Scoping via --sitesfile While above --siteslist option is convenient it becomes hard to use when you want to scope to tens or hundreds of site collections. For that purpose the --sitesfile argument is a better solution. You simply point the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool to a text file containing the site collection URLs to assess. A sample: --sitesfile \"C:\\Microsoft365AssessmentTool\\sites.txt\" . The text file itself is just a list of site URLs: https://bertonline.sharepoint.com/sites/ussales https://bertonline.sharepoint.com/sites/europesales https://bertonline.sharepoint.com/sites/apacsales Note You cannot combine both --siteslist and --sitesfile . When you don't have a sites file available it's quite easy to generate one following these steps: Go to your SharePoint admin center and under Sites select Active sites Select the view that the most closely matches the list of sites you want to assess and click on Export . This will generate a sites CSV file Open the CSV file in Excel, select the URL column (column B) and press CTRL-C to copy that column Open a text editor (e.g. Notepad) and paste the copied column Final step will be to remove the first line as that's the column title (URL) and save the file Authentication configuration The main authentication argument to use the --authmode argument that allows you to choose how the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool will authenticate to your tenant. Possible values are: Authentication mode Description Application Use this mode if you want to use application permissions. This assumes you've configured an Entra application to support application permissions. You'll need to specify the certificate to use for authentication via either the --certpath argument or use the --certfile and --certpassword arguments. Interactive Use this mode if you want to use delegated permissions and you're using a Windows or macOS computer. This assumes you've configured an Entra application to support delegated permissions. When you use this mode a browser window will be opened asking you to authenticate. Device Use this mode if you want to use delegated permissions and you're using a Linux computer. This assumes you've configured an Entra application to support delegated permissions. When using this mode you'll see a code on the command line which you'll need to use at https://aka.ms/devicelogin to complete the authentication flow. Defining the Entra application to use via --applicationid As mentioned in the configure authentication page it's required to create an Entra application. To tell the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool which Entra application it should use you need to specify the Entra application id via the --applicationid argument. A sample: --applicationid c545f9ce-1c11-440b-812b-0b35217d9e83 . Specifying the certificate to use when using application permissions When you've chosen to use application permissions you need to tell the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool the certificate it needs to use for authentication. Two modes are supported: you either point to a certificate already stored in a certificate store on your computer ( --certpath ) or you point to a PFX file containing the certificate ( --certfile ). When using a PFX file you also need to specify the password to open the file via --certpassword . When using --certpath some additional information is needed to understand how the --certpath argument (e.g. My|CurrentUser|b133d1cb4d19ce539986c7ac67de005481084c84 ) needs to be defined. You typically use the My or Root store names followed by either CurrentUser or LocalMachine to identify the location of the certificate store on your computer. The last part is the thumbprint of the certificate you want to use. Note If you're using the LocalMachine store location then be aware that you'll need to ensure the user running the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool has permissions to read the certificate private key in the LocalMachine store. You can do this by granting the account you're using to run the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool permissions to read the private key by opening up the local machine certificate console ( certlm.msc ), navigating to the certificate you're using, right click on the certificate, choose All Tasks -> Manage private keys... and add your user account with read permissions. Clearing the authentication cache When using delegated permissions in combination with either --authmode equal to Interactive or Device then you're seeing a one time prompt for credentials when you use this option for the first time. As part of this operation the authentication library (MSAL) state is cached on disk using machine/user specific encryption. With this cache the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool can automatically request new access tokens whenever that's needed. If you're however switching between tenants or you want to remove this stored cache you can do so via the cache action. Sample: microsoft365-assessment.exe cache --clearauthentication . Note An alternative way of clearing this cache is by deleting the msalcache.bin file inside the folder hosting microsoft365-assessment.exe . Other configuration options Depending on the chosen assessment mode ( --mode argument) you can optionally define extra arguments. Microsoft Syntex adoption assessment When running this assessment it's recommended to use the --syntexfull argument, adding this argument will make the assessment use search to gather exact file counts per content type and retention label counts. This however also requires that your Entra application is correctly configured to allow this. See the specific Microsoft Syntex assessment page to learn more. Parallel operations By default the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool will use multiple parallel operations to read data from your tenant. By default one operation per logical processor is used with a maximum of 10, but you can change this number via the --threads argument. Important Running too many parallel operations will make it more likely the assessment will be throttled. Using between 4 and 8 threads is a good starting point. Running multiple parallel assessments The Microsoft 365 Assessment tool supports running up to 3 parallel assessments, but do note that just like with bumping up the amount of parallel operations this will increase the likelihood of getting throttled. Assessing a Multi-Geo tenant When you want to assess all sites in a Multi-Geo tenant you do have to run an assessment per geo location. For the main geo location you follow the standard flow like described above, for the other geo locations you need to specify the site collections to start via using either the --sitesfile or --siteslist arguments. Below table shows an example for a SharePoint Workflow 2013 assessment: Url Geo location Main Assessment start arguments contoso.sharepoint.com EUR Yes start --mode workflow --authmode application --tenant contoso.sharepoint.com --applicationid 26ff597b-03bf-401a-9f4f-bb3ee8b82478 --certpath \"My|CurrentUser|A1FCF8AFC6E7421CCB2FA2877743E74C6CE80ABD\" contosonam.sharepoint.com NAM No start --mode workflow --authmode application --tenant contoso.sharepoint.com --applicationid 26ff597b-03bf-401a-9f4f-bb3ee8b82478 --certpath \"My|CurrentUser|A1FCF8AFC6E7421CCB2FA2877743E74C6CE80ABD\" --sitesfile \"c:\\assessment\\namsites.txt\" contosoapc.sharepoint.com APC No start --mode workflow --authmode application --tenant contoso.sharepoint.com --applicationid 26ff597b-03bf-401a-9f4f-bb3ee8b82478 --certpath \"My|CurrentUser|A1FCF8AFC6E7421CCB2FA2877743E74C6CE80ABD\" --sitesfile \"c:\\assessment\\apcsites.txt\" Note The --tenant parameter is the same for each assessment, no matter which geo location is being assessed."

    "keywords": "Microsoft 365 Assessment tool configuration For the majority of users no additional configuration is needed, but for example when you're using a tenant in another cloud or using vanity URLs additional configuration is needed before the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool can be used. The appsettings.json configuration file Additional configuration settings are all defined via a settings file named appsettings.json . By default this file is not present, so when you need additional configuration you first need to start with adding a file named appsettings.json in the same location as where you've put the assessment tool microsoft365-assessment.exe . The empty starting contents for this file are shown below: { \"CustomSettings\": { } } A fully configured file could look like this: { \"PnPCore\": { \"Environment\": \"Production\" }, \"CustomSettings\": { \"Environment\": \"Production\", \"Port\": 7887, \"AdminCenterUrl\": \"https://spo-admin.contoso.com\", \"MySiteHostUrl\": \"https://my.contoso.com\" } } Cloud environment configuration The assessment tool can be used to run against tenants hosted in other cloud environments by specifying the environment to use in the settings file as shown below. { \"PnPCore\": { \"Environment\": \"USGovernmentHigh\" }, \"CustomSettings\": { \"Environment\": \"USGovernmentHigh\" } } Valid values for environment are: Production (this is default if not set, this also works for GCC), PreProduction (Microsoft internal only), USGovernmentHigh (a.k.a GCC High), USGovernmentDoD (a.k.a DoD), China and Germany . Vanity URL configuration A handful tenants use custom URLs due to historic reasons (so called vanity URLs) and when you want to use the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool you'll need to let the tool know these custom URLs by specifying them in the settings file: { \"CustomSettings\": { \"AdminCenterUrl\": \"https://spo-admin.contoso.com\", \"MySiteHostUrl\": \"https://my.contoso.com\" } } Important Both URLs have to specified when you're using vanity URLs. Next to the using the configuration file you also need to either use the --sitesfile or --siteslist arguments when starting a new assessment . Enumerating all site collections in a vanity URL tenant will be added in a future release. Using a different port than 25010 The Microsoft 365 Assessment tool process accepts commands by listening on localhost port 25010. For most computers this port is a free and can be used, but if for some reason you prefer to use another port than that's possible as well: { \"CustomSettings\": { \"Port\": 7887 } } Disabling telemetry When using the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool basic telemetry information is sent to Microsoft. This information is used to understand how the tool is being used which helps us improve the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool going forward. If you however prefer to not sent and telemetry information then that's possible by adding an environment variable named PNP_DISABLETELEMETRY with a value of true . After restarting the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool no telemetry data will be sent anymore."

    "keywords": "Download the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool Before being able to use the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool you first wil have to download it. Download the latest version The Microsoft 365 Assessment tool versions are available via the GitHub releases page of the repository hosting the open source Microsoft 365 Assessment tool. There are three flavors of the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool, a Windows version, macOS version and Linux version. It's recommended to always use the latest version. When using the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool the tool outputs (reports, CSV files, logs) will be placed inside the folder containing the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool, hence it's recommended to put the downloaded Microsoft 365 Assessment tool somewhere inside a dedicated folder on your computer's file system. E.g. create a folder c:\\microsoft365assessment and copy the microsoft365-assessment.exe file in that folder. Version updates When you launch the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool it will check if there's a newer version and will notify you, downloading the newest version is a manual step and highly recommended whenever there is one. Important When you download the new version you need to ensure the previous Microsoft 365 Assessment tool is not running anymore as otherwise you might get \"file in use\" errors while overwriting or the new version will still connected to the old running process. Below are some strategies to ensure the current Microsoft 365 Assessment tool is fully shutdown. Using the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool CLI First check if there's no running assessment anymore via microsoft365-assessment.exe status , if OK then use microsoft365-assessment.exe stop to stop the running Microsoft 365 Assessment process. Using your OS's task manager List all the running tasks and stop all microsoft365-assessment.exe processes on Windows or all microsoft365-assessment processes on macOS or Linux. Is it safe to just run a downloaded executable The Microsoft 365 Assessment tool is an open source managed tool, but the release process is a Microsoft managed one. This means that tool changes are reviewed by Microsoft and that the shipped Windows versions of the tool are code signed by Microsoft, which prevents tampering with the binary file. Furthermore it's not required and therefore not recommended to run the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool using elevated privileges. Running on macOS and Linux After copying the needed binary from the releases folder you need to mark the binary as executable via sudo chmod +x microsoft365-assessment . Once that's done you can use the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool, the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool binary itself contains all the needed dependencies (including the .NET 6 runtime). While the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool can be used on macOS and Linux, there are some limitations on these platforms: the Power BI report generation will be skipped since Power BI Desktop is only is available for Windows. You however will be able to run an assessment and generate the needed CSV files containing the assessment results. If you later on want to generate the Power BI report for an assessment ran on Linux of macOS, you then can copy the assessment output folder (guid = assessment id, located in the folder containing the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool) to the folder on a Windows machine where you've put the Windows version of the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool. When you then use microsoft365-assessment.exe report --id <assessment id> the report will be generated and opened in Power BI Desktop."

    "title": "Configure authentication | Microsoft 365 Assessment Tool",
    "keywords": "Configure authentication The Microsoft 365 Assessment tool uses Entra (Azure AD) based authentication and requires a configured Entra application to run. The Microsoft 365 Assessment tool supports both application permissions (app-only) and delegated (user) permissions and various ways to authenticate. Important If you want the assessment tool to read all sites in your tenant then using application permissions is strongly recommended as that's the only way to guarantee that the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool can read all the sites. When you want to only assess a couple of sites and your account has permissions to these sites then using delegated permissions is an option. Setting up the Entra application A configured Entra application is a pre-requisite for using the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool. When you start an assessment you'll have to specify the Entra application to use and how you want to authenticate. It's strongly recommended to create a dedicated Entra application over re-using an existing one so you can limit the needed permissions to what's needed by the module you're using in the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool. Also as throttling rules are bound to applications there's less throttling impact if you use a dedicated Entra application for the assessments. Permissions required The Microsoft 365 Assessment tool aims to be able to perform the assessment task at hand using minimal read permissions, but for certain assessments not all features work when using minimal permissions. To understand which Microsoft Graph and SharePoint permissions are required please checkout the permission requirements of the respective modules. Microsoft Syntex adoption Workflow 2013 deprecation InfoPath 2013 deprecation SharePoint Add-Ins and Azure ACS deprecation Important Cross check the minimally required permissions are granted, if not the scan might fail or might return inaccurate results. Creating an Entra application using PnP PowerShell Using PnP PowerShell creating an Entra application becomes really simple. The Register-PnPAzureADApp cmdlet will create a new Entra application, will create a new self-signed certificate inside the Personal node (= My ) of the CurrentUser certificate store, and will hookup that cert with the created Entra application. Finally the right permissions are configured and you're prompted to consent these permissions. Important If you encounter errors during below steps it's likely that you do not have the needed permissions. Please contact your tenant / Entra admins for help. # Sample for the Microsoft Syntex adoption module. # Remove/update the application/delegated permissions depending on your needs # as each assessment module requires slightly different permissions. # # Also update the Tenant and Username properties to match your environment. # # If you prefer to have a password set to secure the created PFX file then add below parameter # -CertificatePassword (ConvertTo-SecureString -String \"password\" -AsPlainText -Force) # # See https://pnp.github.io/powershell/cmdlets/Register-PnPAzureADApp.html for more options # Register-PnPAzureADApp -ApplicationName Microsoft365AssessmentToolForSyntex ` -Tenant contoso.onmicrosoft.com ` -Store CurrentUser ` -GraphApplicationPermissions \"Sites.Read.All\" ` -SharePointApplicationPermissions \"Sites.FullControl.All\" ` -GraphDelegatePermissions \"Sites.Read.All\", \"User.Read\" ` -SharePointDelegatePermissions \"AllSites.Manage\" ` -Username \"joe@contoso.onmicrosoft.com\" ` -Interactive Note Replace contoso.onmicrosoft.com with your Entra tenant name and ensure you replace joe@contoso.onmicrosoft.com with the user id that's an Entra admin (or global admin). If you're unsure what your Entra tenant name is then go to https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/TenantOverview.ReactView and check for the value of Primary domain . Once you've pressed enter on above command, you'll be prompted to sign-in and you should sign-in using the user you've specified for the Username parameter. After that's done the Entra application will be created and configured, followed by a wait of 60 seconds to ensure the creation has been propagated across all systems. The final step is the admin consent flow: you'll again be prompted to sign-in with the specified admin user, followed by a consent dialog showing the permissions that are being granted to the application. Press Accept to finalize the consent flow. In the resulting output you'll get some key information: Pfx file : D:\\assessment\\Microsoft365AssessmentTool.pfx Cer file : D:\\assessment\\Microsoft365AssessmentTool.cer AzureAppId/ClientId : 95610f5d-729a-4cd1-9ad7-1fa9052e50dd Certificate Thumbprint : 165CCE93E08FD3CD85B7B25D5E91C05B1D1E49FE Running the Register-PnPAzureADApp did not only create and configure the Entra application, it also did create a certificate for the application permission flow. This certificate has been added to the current user's certificate store, under the personal node. You can use certmgr on the command line to open up the local user's certificate store. Note The certificate is also exported as PFX file and cer file on the file system, feel free to delete these exported files as it's easier to use the certificate from the certificate store. When you now want to use the certificate for starting an assessment, you need to set --authmode to application and tell the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool which certificate to use via the certificate path parameter: --certpath \"My|CurrentUser|165CCE93E08FD3CD85B7B25D5E91C05B1D1E49FE\" . Next to that you also need to specify the Entra application to use via the --applicationid parameter. More details on how to configure authentication when starting an assessment can be found here . Important Notice that the last part in the --certpath string is the certificate thumbprint to use. If you've not captured that thumbprint earlier on you can get it by looking up your certificate via certmgr , opening it to the Details tab and scrolling down to the Thumbprint field. Select the shown value and press CTRL-C to copy it. Creating an Entra application using the Entra Portal Previous chapter described approach that creates and configures an Entra application by using PnP PowerShell . If you want to manually create the Entra application that's an option as well. Follow below steps to create and configure your Entra application: Navigate to Entra Portal and click on Applications , followed by App registrations from the left navigation Click on New registration page Provide a Name for your Entra application (e.g. Microsoft365AssessmentToolForWorkflow) Select Public client/native (mobile & desktop) and enter http://localhost as redirect URI Click on Register and the Entra application gets created and opened Choose API permissions from the left navigation and add the needed delegated and/or application permissions. See the requirements page of the module you want to use for the exact permissions Click on Grant admin consent for... to consent the added permissions When you want to use the Device authentication then also: Under Authentication set Allow public client flows to Yes When you want to use Application authentication then also: Ensure you've defined the needed application permissions via the API permissions link the left navigation. See the requirements page of the module you want to use for the exact permissions and don't forget to click on Grant admin consent for... to consent the added permissions Go to Certificates & secrets , click on Certificates and Upload certificate , pick the .cer file of your certificate and add it. Note If you don't have a certificate available then you can use Windows PowerShell to create one: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-self-signed-certificate ."

Since the release of SharePoint workflows, Microsoft has evolved workflow orchestration to not only encompass SharePoint, but all the productivity services you use within Microsoft 365 and extend to 3rd parties. Power Automate is the Microsoft solution for workflow orchestration. It connects to all Microsoft 365 services and over 220 other services to let an enterprise build custom workflows. There are also many 3rd party solutions that can directly orchestrate SharePoint data via SharePoint’s open API platform. SharePoint 2010 Workflows was retired as of November 1st 2020 and it is strongly recommended to also move your 2013 workflows to the Power Automate platform or other modern workflow orchestration solutions. The new Microsoft 365 Assessment Tool helps you identify and evaluate the SharePoint 2013 workflows on your tenant by providing you the usage data of SharePoint 2013 Workflows , and generating a Power BI report to help plan migrating 2013 workflows to a modern workflow orchestration service."

The Overview page will give you a quick overview while the Details page allows you to further drill in When the report is opened from the generated Power BI pbit file it's not saved, meaning if you close Power BI Desktop it will ask you to save the file. You can also save the opened report yourselves using the save icon top left, when saving as a Power BI pbix file the data and report are combined into a single file, making it easier for your to move around and share the report If you want to update the visualizations used you can use the toolbar and visualizations and fields sections at the right You can use the left navigation to learn more about each report page."

Authentication Minimal Application Graph: Sites.Read.All SharePoint: Sites.Manage.All Delegated Graph: Sites.Read.All, User.Read SharePoint: AllSites.Manage Command line arguments for starting an assessment When starting the Workflow 2013 assessment you optionally opt out from the detailed analysis of the workflow via the --workflowanalyze:false argument. Doing so will mean skipping all the reporting and data that help you understand what actions are used in the workflow and how upgradable these are to Power Automate, hence it's not recommended to use this argument. Note To learn more about starting an assessment checkout the Microsoft 365 Assessment tool Start documentation ."
